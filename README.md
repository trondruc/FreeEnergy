# FreeEnergy
RUMD scripts for free energy calculations of atomic liquids, rigid molecules, and atomic solids.

The liquid scripts use thermodynamic integration (TI) from an "ideal" gas of atoms or rigid molecules. The solid scripts use TI with an Einstein crystal as the reference (atomic Frenkel-Ladd method).

Contains a Jupyter Python notebook in Validation comparing with literature results.
